#+TITLE: study.gl

*study.gl* is a repository where I implement a rendering engine using C++ and OpenGL.

* Building
Make sure you have the following tools installed:
- just :: command runner
- cmake :: build system
- gcc or clang :: compiler
- git :: to fetch the project + its dependencies

You can download them with your favourite package manager:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S git cmake make just gcc
#+END_SRC

In order to build the app you should first clone the repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/SqLait/study.gl.git
#+END_SRC

After that, you can compile and run the project like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
just init
just run
#+END_SRC
